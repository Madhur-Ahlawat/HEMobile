            <li>
                <b>Opening of a new Account</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>You may open a new Account by telephone, post or via the Website. To do so,
                        you must provide all of the information requested on the Account Application
                        form or by phone and provide the Initial Credit Payment and, if you are
                        joining the Local Residents Discount Scheme, the Annual Registration Fee.
                        Please note that if you choose to pay your Initial Credit Payment by cheque
                        it may delay your Account being opened as we will have to wait for the
                        payment to clear. Until such time, all Charges incurred must be paid for
                        using one of the other methods available and will not include a Discount.
                    </li>
                    <li>You cannot register the same vehicle to more than one Account. You can
                        register multiple vehicles to one Account.
                    </li>
                    <li>By applying, you confirm that all information you give us is true and
                        correct to the best of your knowledge. You also confirm that you are the
                        registered keeper of the vehicle(s) that you register to your Account or
                        have the permission of the registered keeper(s) to register their vehicle to
                        your Account and receive information about the vehicle and its crossings.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Agreement between us is formed as follows:
                        <br>a. if you have applied online - when we send you a confirmation email
                        that your Account has been opened successfully;
                        <br>
                        b. if you have applied by telephone - once our customer representative
                        confirms that your Account has been opened successfully;
                        <br>c. if you have applied by post - once we send you either an
                        acknowledgement or Welcome Pack (whichever is the earlier).
                    </li>

                    <li>We will send a Welcome Pack to the email or postal address you gave as soon
                        as possible after your Account Application is accepted and all payments
                        required have been received and cleared. If your Account Application is
                        unsuccessful, we will notify you and may ask you to provide us with more
                        information.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once your Account is open it will become active immediately and any Charges
                        incurred by you will automatically be deducted.
                    </li>
                    <li>Your details necessary for us to operate this Agreement and your Account
                        will be processed by us in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
                    </li>

                <b>Cancellation Period</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>You have the right to cancel this Agreement at any time within 14 days
                        beginning on the day after the Agreement is formed under clause 1.4 (the
                        "Cancellation Period"). If you wish to cancel, you simply need to tell us.
                        You can tell us by phone on
                        <a href="tel:03003000120">0300 3000120</a>
                        or online at

                        .
                    </li>
                    <li>If you cancel within the Cancellation Period:
                        <br>a. we will not charge you for cancelling this Agreement; and
                        <br>b. we will refund to you all money you have paid to us, except for any
                        money that has already been deducted (or that is due to be deducted) from
                        your Account to pay for Charges you have incurred prior to you cancelling
                        this Agreement. We will provide the refund within 14 days beginning on the
                        day after you told us you want to cancel using the same method you paid
                        with.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any termination of this Agreement by you after the Cancellation Period is to
                        be done only as specified in clause 10.2.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition System</b>
                <br>
                We use an Automatic Number Plate Recognition System to record images of your vehicle
                (and its number plate) to calculate the Charges due from your Account. By entering
                into this Agreement you consent to these images being acquired and processed by us
                and that we may retain and use any such images in accordance with, and for the
                purposes described in, our Privacy Policy.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Notification of Sale or Theft of Vehicle</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>If your vehicle is sold or stolen you must immediately notify us so that we
                        can remove the vehicle from your account. If you have been charged for
                        Crossings made after the vehicle was sold or stolen then you must tell us
                        immediately by telephone.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you do not notify us in accordance with clause 4.1 You'll remain liable
                        for any Charges incurred by the vehicle and your Account will continue to be
                        debited for those Charges.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you have sold your vehicle and bought another one, you can register a new
                        vehicle to your Account by updating your Account either online, by telephone
                        or by writing to us using the contact details in clause 16.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Collection of Charges</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>You must specify in your Account Application your proposed method of payment
                        of the Charges. If your method of payment is:<br>a. by Auto-Top-Up, you must
                        complete the Mandate instruction online, by phone, or using the form
                        attached to the Account Application form. If you wish to use the crossing
                        before the Mandate is processed, you must also provide details of another
                        acceptable method of payment to cover your Charges; or
                        <br>b. by Manual Top-Up, you must complete the details relevant to your
                        proposed method of payment in the Account application form and make the
                        Initial Credit Payment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Please note that if you submit a Mandate to us, you are providing your
                        continuing authority for Charges to be deducted from your bank account
                        pursuant to that Mandate. If payment via the Mandate fails at any time for
                        any reason, we will automatically deduct the relevant Charges from your
                        credit or debit card using the details you have provided to us.
                    </li>
                    <li>We will be entitled to deduct from your Account all Charges (less the
                        Discount), and other sums due to us pursuant to this Agreement, as they are
                        incurred.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you choose to pay by Auto-Top-Up you can set the minimum balance
                        threshold (subject to a £5 minimum) which will trigger an Auto-Top-Up
                        payment.
                    </li>
                    <li>You may monitor your Account by logging on to your Account homepage on our
                        Website using your log in details. Your Account has information relating to:
                        <br>a. the money you have paid into your Account;
                        <br>b. the amount of Charges (less the Discount) and other sums we have
                        deducted from your Account; and
                        <br>c. any such other information as we consider appropriate in relation to
                        your Account in respect of the previous month.
                    </li>
                    <li>Where you have provided us with a valid email address, we will send you an
                        email with a link to your statement. We will not provide you with a printed
                        statement of Account, in respect of any given month, unless:
                        <br>a. you have indicated in your Account application or subsequently told
                        us that you require a statement in paper form;
                        <br>b. you agreed to pay an additional charge to Conduent for such paper
                        statements, the amount of which we will notify you of in advance so that you
                        can choose if you want to proceed. We may vary this charge from time to time
                        on notice to you but if you object to the new charge, you can cancel your
                        paper statements; and
                        <br>c. there has been activity on your Account in that month. In these
                        circumstances, we will provide you with a statement on the same day in the
                        month that you opened the Account or on the last business day of the month
                        (if earlier). We may, from time to time, change the duration covered by or
                        frequency of your statements but, if we do so, we will notify you of that
                        change in advance.
                    </li>
                    <li>You may change the amount of your Auto-Top-Up at any time (subject to a £10
                        minimum). You can either do this by logging into your Account through our
                        Website, or by giving us at least 15 days' prior notice in writing and, if
                        required, by completing an amended Auto-Top-Up authorisation.
                    </li>
                    <li>You must only maintain from time to time an amount of credit in your Account
                        that is reasonably required to meet future Charges applicable to the
                        vehicle(s) specified in your Account Application. If on reasonable grounds
                        we believe that you are holding credit balances on your Account in excess of
                        the amount reasonably required to meet future Charges (for example, if your
                        Account balance is more than double the amount you pay into your Account per
                        month (as specified in your Account Application)), we may, by notice, either
                        reduce your credit balance by returning to you the excess amount from your
                        Account, or treat the making of the excess payment(s) as a breach of this
                        Agreement and give you notice to terminate it pursuant to clause 10.1(f)
                        (ii). The account will be terminated unless you can provide justification
                        satisfactory to us as to why it is appropriate to maintain the level of
                        credit balance in question.
                    </li>
                    <li>Apart from payment by Mandate, other acceptable methods of paying the
                        Charges are payments by debit or credit card (excluding American Express),
                        postal order and cheque (UK sterling) drawn on a UK clearing bank account or
                        cash (UK sterling)
                    </li>
                    <li>You may be issued with a Penalty Charge Notice for any unpaid Crossing.
                        Non-payment of a Penalty Charge Notice could result in an additional charge
                        being payable by you which if not paid could be registered as a debt against
                        your name in the County Court.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <li>
                <b>Account Suspension</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is your responsibility to keep your Account in credit. Having an Account
                        will not prevent a Penalty Charge Notice being issued if your Account
                        balance is insufficient to cover any Charges incurred by your vehicle(s), so
                        please monitor your Account and ensure you have sufficient credit at all
                        times.
                    </li>
                    <li>Your Account will be suspended in the following circumstances:</li>
                    <br>a. when a Charge is incurred by a vehicle registered to the Account for
                    which there are insufficient funds in the Account;
                    <br>b. if the Account contains insufficient funds to settle the full Charge for
                    a Crossing by the vehicle in the lowest charging class associated to the
                    Account;
                    <br>c. the Account has a credit balance of less than £2.
                    <li>If your Account has been suspended, You'll receive a notification advising
                        you to: a. make payment for any unpaid Crossings; b. top-up your Account to
                        at least the minimum balance threshold. 6.4 Where you have not taken one of
                        the actions described in clause 6.3 within 5 days of you being notified that
