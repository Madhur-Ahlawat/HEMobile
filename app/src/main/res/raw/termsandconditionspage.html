<br><br>



<ol>
    <li><b> Opening of a new Account</b>
        <ol>
            <li>You may open a new Account by telephone, post or via the Website. To do so, you must provide all of the information requested on the Account Application form or by phone and provide the Initial Credit Payment and, if you are joining the Local Residents Discount Scheme, the Annual Registration Fee. Please note that if you choose to pay your Initial Credit Payment by cheque it may delay your Account being opened as we will have to wait for the payment to clear. Until such time, all Charges incurred must be paid for using one of the other methods available and will not include a Discount.</li>
            <li>You cannot register the same vehicle to more than one Account. You can register multiple vehicles to one Account.</li>
            <li>By applying, you confirm that all information you give us is true and correct to the best of your knowledge. You also confirm that you are the registered keeper of the vehicle(s) that you register to your Account or have the permission of the registered keeper(s) to register their vehicle to your Account and receive information about the vehicle and its crossings.</li>
            <li>The Agreement between us is formed as follows:
                <br>a. if you have applied online - when we send you a confirmation email that your Account has been opened successfully;
                <br> b. if you have applied by telephone - once our customer representative confirms that your Account has been opened successfully;
                <br>c. if you have applied by post - once we send you either an acknowledgement or Welcome Pack (whichever is the earlier).
            </li>
            
            <li>We will send a Welcome Pack to the email or postal address you gave as soon as possible after your Account Application is accepted and all payments required have been received and cleared. If your Account Application is unsuccessful, we will notify you and may ask you to provide us with more information.</li>
            <li>Once your Account is open it will become active immediately and any Charges incurred by you will automatically be deducted.</li>
            <li>Your details necessary for us to operate this Agreement and your Account will be processed by us in accordance with the Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ol>
    </li><br>
    <li><b> Cancellation Period </b>
        <ol>
            <li>You have the right to cancel this Agreement at any time within 14 days beginning on the day after the Agreement is formed under clause 1.4 (the "Cancellation Period"). If you wish to cancel, you simply need to tell us. You can tell us by phone on <a href="tel:03003000120">0300 3000120</a> or online at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/dart-charge">www.gov.uk/dart-charge</a> .</li>
            <li>If you cancel within the Cancellation Period:
                <br>a. we will not charge you for cancelling this Agreement; and
                <br>b. we will refund to you all money you have paid to us, except for any money that has already been deducted (or that is due to be deducted) from your Account to pay for Charges you have incurred prior to you cancelling this Agreement. We will provide the refund within 14 days beginning on the day after you told us you want to cancel using the same method you paid with.
            </li>
            <li>Any termination of this Agreement by you after the Cancellation Period is to be done only as specified in clause 10.2.</li>
        </ol>
    </li><br>
    
    <li><b>Use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition System</b>
        <br> We use an Automatic Number Plate Recognition System to record images of your vehicle (and its number plate) to calculate the Charges due from your Account. By entering into this Agreement you consent to these images being acquired and processed by us and that we may retain and use any such images in accordance with, and for the purposes described in, our Privacy Policy.
    </li><br>
    
    <li><b>Notification of Sale or Theft of Vehicle</b>
        <ol>
            <li>If your vehicle is sold or stolen you must immediately notify us so that we can remove the vehicle from your account. If you have been charged for Crossings made after the vehicle was sold or stolen then you must tell us immediately by telephone.</li>
            <li>If you do not notify us in accordance with clause 4.1 You'll remain liable for any Charges incurred by the vehicle and your Account will continue to be debited for those Charges.</li>
            <li>If you have sold your vehicle and bought another one, you can register a new vehicle to your Account by updating your Account either online, by telephone or by writing to us using the contact details in clause 16.</li>
        </ol>
    </li><br>
    
    <li><b>Collection of Charges</b>
        <ol>
            <li>You must specify in your Account Application your proposed method of payment of the Charges. If your method of payment is: <br>a. by Auto-Top-Up, you must complete the Mandate instruction online, by phone, or using the form attached to the Account Application form. If you wish to use the crossing before the Mandate is processed, you must also provide details of another acceptable method of payment to cover your Charges; or
                <br>b. by Manual Top-Up, you must complete the details relevant to your proposed method of payment in the Account application form and make the Initial Credit Payment.
            </li>
            <li>Please note that if you submit a Mandate to us, you are providing your continuing authority for Charges to be deducted from your bank account pursuant to that Mandate. If payment via the Mandate fails at any time for any reason, we will automatically deduct the relevant Charges from your credit or debit card using the details you have provided to us.</li>
            <li>We will be entitled to deduct from your Account all Charges (less the Discount), and other sums due to us pursuant to this Agreement, as they are incurred.</li>
            <li>If you choose to pay by Auto-Top-Up you can set the minimum balance threshold (subject to a Â£5 minimum) which will trigger an Auto-Top-Up payment.</li>
            <li>You may monitor your Account by logging on to your Account homepage on our Website using your log in details. Your Account has information relating to:
                <br>a. the money you have paid into your Account;
                <br>b. the amount of Charges (less the Discount) and other sums we have deducted from your Account; and
                <br>c. any such other information as we consider appropriate in relation to your Account in respect of the previous month.
            </li>
            <li>Where you have provided us with a valid email address, we will send you an email with a link to your statement. We will not provide you with a printed statement of Account, in respect of any given month, unless:
                <br>a. you have indicated in your Account application or subsequently told us that you require a statement in paper form;
                <br>b. you agreed to pay an additional charge to Conduent for such paper statements, the amount of which we will notify you of in advance so that you can choose if you want to proceed. We may vary this charge from time to time on notice to you but if you object to the new charge, you can cancel your paper statements; and
                <br>c. there has been activity on your Account in that month. In these circumstances, we will provide you with a statement on the same day in the month that you opened the Account or on the last business day of the month (if earlier). We may, from time to time, change the duration covered by or frequency of your statements but, if we do so, we will notify you of that change in advance.
            </li>
            <li>You may change the amount of your Auto-Top-Up at any time (subject to a Â£10 minimum). You can either do this by logging into your Account through our Website, or by giving us at least 15 days' prior notice in writing and, if required, by completing an amended Auto-Top-Up authorisation.</li>
            <li>You must only maintain from time to time an amount of credit in your Account that is reasonably required to meet future Charges applicable to the vehicle(s) specified in your Account Application. If on reasonable grounds we believe that you are holding credit balances on your Account in excess of the amount reasonably required to meet future Charges (for example, if your Account balance is more than double the amount you pay into your Account per month (as specified in your Account Application)), we may, by notice, either reduce your credit balance by returning to you the excess amount from your Account, or treat the making of the excess payment(s) as a breach of this Agreement and give you notice to terminate it pursuant to clause 10.1(f) (ii). The account will be terminated unless you can provide justification satisfactory to us as to why it is appropriate to maintain the level of credit balance in question.</li>
            <li>Apart from payment by Mandate, other acceptable methods of paying the Charges are payments by debit or credit card (excluding American Express), postal order and cheque (UK sterling) drawn on a UK clearing bank account or cash (UK sterling)</li>
            <li>You may be issued with a Penalty Charge Notice for any unpaid Crossing. Non-payment of a Penalty Charge Notice could result in an additional charge being payable by you which if not paid could be registered as a debt against your name in the County Court.</li>
        </ol>
    </li><br>
    
    <li><b>Account Suspension</b>
        <ol>
            <li>It is your responsibility to keep your Account in credit. Having an Account will not prevent a Penalty Charge Notice being issued if your Account balance is insufficient to cover any Charges incurred by your vehicle(s), so please monitor your Account and ensure you have sufficient credit at all times.</li>
            <li>Your Account will be suspended in the following circumstances:</li>
            <br>a. when a Charge is incurred by a vehicle registered to the Account for which there are insufficient funds in the Account;
            <br>b. if the Account contains insufficient funds to settle the full Charge for a Crossing by the vehicle in the lowest charging class associated to the Account;
            <br>c. the Account has a credit balance of less than Â£2.
            <li>If your Account has been suspended, You'll receive a notification advising you to: a. make payment for any unpaid Crossings; b. top-up your Account to at least the minimum balance threshold. 6.4 Where you have not taken one of the actions described in clause 6.3 within 5 days of you being notified that your Account is being suspended, your Account will be classified as Dormant and become eligible for closure under clause 10.1(g).</li>

                <br>g. to notify us immediately if you cancel or alter your Mandate or do not intend to continue making payments by any of the other methods described in clause 5.9;
                <br>h. to pay the Charges in full;

                <br>l. to ensure that the number plate attached to your vehicle is clearly visible, not likely to be misread due to damage, deterioration or because the characters are obscured, and complies with The Road Vehicles (Display of Registration Marks) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/561) (as amended); and
                <br>m. that your Account can only be used to pay for Charges incurred by the vehicle(s) registered to the Account.
