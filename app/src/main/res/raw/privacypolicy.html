This policy explains how National Highways use the personal information collected from you for the operation of the Dart Charge scheme. It also describes how long that information is kept for and the limited circumstances in which we might disclose it to third parties.
<br><br>
<b>Personal details we hold</b><br>
National Highways hold three types of personal information which allow us to manage the Dart Charge scheme:
<br><br>Customer provided information: customers' contact details, their vehicle registration marks and payment preferences are used to administer accounts and one-off payments for crossings.
<br>Customer contact records – Records of calls, emails and postal interactions with our website and customer centre are maintained for audit, training and service improvement purposes.
<br>Crossing records – Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras capture images and record vehicle registrations whenever a vehicle uses the Crossing. These are retained as evidence in the event of a dispute. In the event of non-payment, the details of the registered keeper are provided to National Highways by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) as well as by various Credit reference agencies. This allows us to issue penalty charge notices (PCNs) for non-payment of the charge.

<br><br><b>Length of time information will be held</b>
<br>In order to comply with the General Data Protection Regulations, your details will only be kept for the shortest time required. This will vary according to the type of data being held.

<br><br><b>How to access your personal data</b>
<br>If you wish to see full details of the information Dart Charge holds in connection with you, You'll need to make a subject access request under the General Data Protection Regulations. If you've received a PCN, there will be two images on the notice itself. If you wish to obtain any additional images we might hold of your vehicle, or other personal data which we hold, you must make a formal subject access request. If you have not received a PCN there are only limited circumstances in which we might retain images of your vehicle. You'll still need to submit a subject access request to obtain any such images. To initiate a subject access request, email: <a href="customerservice@dartford-crossing-charge.service.gov.uk">customerservice@dartford-crossing-charge.service.gov.uk</a> or call us on 0300 300 0120
<br><br><b>Keeping your details secure</b>
<br>National Highways has a contract with Conduent Public Sector UK Ltd and Emovis Operations Leeds Ltd (our service providers) who provide the administration and 'back office' services for the scheme. We store all of our information in highly secure UK data centres where it is protected by the latest encryption and firewall technology. These systems are regularly audited, and penetration tested by external security assessors to ensure your data is safe. Your data will not be sent overseas as part of the normal operation of Dart Charge. We do not store entire credit/debit card numbers, nor do we keep records of the security code of customers' credit or debit cards. These details will be requested during the processing of specific transactions.
<br><br>
<b>Sharing personal information</b>
<br>To support the prevention and detection of crime, Dart Charge provides summary records of all vehicle passages to local police forces. Occasionally, personal information held in relation to Dart Charge may be requested by and disclosed to:
<br>The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)
<br>Local authorities
<br>The police and other statutory law enforcement agencies
<br>The Traffic Penalty Tribunal (should you appeal our decision if you appeal the issue of a PCN)
<br>In the event of an unpaid crossing, debt registration and collection organisations.
<br>Personal data may be shared with these organisations when a valid reason to obtain the data under the General Data Protection Regulations and other data protection legislation is provided. Such requests are dealt with on a strictly case-by-case basis. Additionally, in the course of our day-to-day operations, we may monitor vehicles using the Crossing, including those vehicles which may be exempt or registered for a discount. If we believe we've identified a persistent charge evader, or we observe activity we believe to be fraudulent, we will provide the information to the local authority or the police.
<br><br>
National Highways and its subsidiaries may also contact you about our related services and promotions connected to the operation of the strategic road network, for example, roadworks, crossing closures and travel surveys, etc.
